Cellular automata where each cell contains a convolutional network. The rules of replication of a cell depend on the accuracy of the convolution network's accuracy of predicting the next frame of the cellular automata. The goal is that the conv net that most accurately understands the environment into which it was placed will visually proliferate in the cellular automata, providing an interesting glimpse into the process of meta-cognition.
